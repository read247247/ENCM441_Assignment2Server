/*
 A few notes on efficiency with hash1:
 This will become extremely inefficient as the number of stored words increases. A better solution might be to implement a minimal BST of String/int pairs, with the sorting done by alphabetic order of the Strings. I have a lot to do this week, so have implemented this in the way that required the least extra code on my part.
 */

/*
 The first unique word recieved will hash to 0, the second to 1, and so on
 NOTE: This hash can hold 16^8 - 1 words in the dictionary due to the implementation of converting the hashed values to a string at the end. This should not be a issue, as that is approximately 21,000 times the number of words in the english langauge

/*
 Takes the ascii value of each character, and multiplies it by the character's position in the word, with the first character as 1. Truncates the resulting hex value to 8 digits (the vast majority of hashes do not require truncation)
 
So for the word "The", (ASCII value of 'T') * 1 + (ASCII value of 'h') * 2 + (ASCII value of 'e') * 3 = 84 * 1 + 104 * 2 + 101 * 3 = 595 base 10, which is 0x253.
 
 This method requires only a simple modification of hash2, and dramatically reduces the number of collisions, since it takes the position of each character into account. I am sure collisions exist, but I have been unable to find them.
